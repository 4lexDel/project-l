# TODO
- Tutorial (modal with steps GIF)
- Create a deck area
    * Contains the choosen puzzles
    * COntains the pieces earned
- Create a board area
    * Contains the puzzles stacks
    * Contains the remaining pieces
- Improve the piece insertion (puzzle)
- Add tooltip
- Implement the rules (game process)

- Code organization:
    * Use a structural design pattern like "Chain of Responsibility" https://refactoring.guru/fr/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility/typescript/example

Tech consideration:
- Improve the piece manipulation
- Limit the draw repetition to improve the performance
- Centralise the piece aspect ratio into a static variable

Feature
- Add a "notification" near to the piece to indicate the quantity
- Keep the same piece proportion in the puzzle reward (like the inventory does)


- Add a Card object and Slot object to parse the piece and puzzle object to manage the inventory easily
