# TODO

Tech consideration:
- Improve the piece manipulation
- Limit the draw repetition to improve the performance
- Centralise the piece aspect ratio into a static variable
- Add a Card object and Slot object to parse the piece and puzzle object to manage the inventory easily (Facade pattern?)

- Manage layout inheritance (like in the html container)

Feature
- Add a "notification" near to the piece to indicate the quantity   or  keep the piece alone ?????
- Prepare the opponent side
