## Stack
- Typescript
- Vite

- Limit the draw repetition to improve the performance
- Refactor the objects files ? | Container = OK
- Handle the little gap between the layouts
- Create a Z-INDEX system
- Manage the piece quantity (stacks)
- Manage the piece stack (storage vs display)
- Keep a unique size for the item dragged?

<br>

## Features
- Add some annotations to make it more readable
- Start the game process
- Remove 4 tier 1 pieces
- Add a resize option
