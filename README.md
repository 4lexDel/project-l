# Project L

## Description
The goal of the project is to replicate the game [Project L](https://cdn.1j1ju.com/medias/82/ee/c6-project-l-rulebook.pdf).

## Stack
- Typescript
- Vite
- P5.js (render)

## Current work
Tech consideration:  
- Improve the piece manipulation
- Limit the draw repetition to improve the performance
- Centralise the piece aspect ratio into a static variable
- Add a Card object and Slot object to parse the piece and puzzle object to manage the inventory easily (Facade pattern?)
- Manage layout inheritance (like in the html container)

Features:  
- Add a "notification" near to the piece to indicate the quantity   or  keep the piece alone ?????
- Prepare the opponent side

## Technical help
Classes inheritance (generated by https://devtool.tech/en/tree):
